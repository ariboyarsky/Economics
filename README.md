# Notes from my studies in Economics

A collection of notes and quasi-formal projects from coursework, research, and individual study. This repository is very much a work in progress.  


Specifically, these are notes that I have decided to type up whilst studying for PhD Economics courses at the University of Chicago. Mistakes are certainly present, and are very much my own. Please do not attempt to use this as a replacement for a good textbook in Microeconomics. Otherwise, you will find these notes shockingly defficiant.

If you notice any errors or have other suggestion or additions, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Feel free to alsosend me an email: aboyarsky@uchicago.edu. 

Much of the content comes from Microeconomic Theory by Mas-Collel, Whinston, and Green (MWG), and Advanced Microeconomic Theory by Jehle and Reny (JR). I also thank Professors Murphy, Reny, and Myerson at the University of Chicago for their unbounded insight, and their brilliant expositions in class.


# Checklist
1. Complete proof of WE existence with production
2. Add notes on Rawls, and Gibbard-Satterwaithe
3. Add Game Theory Notes
4. Complete MWG notes, and include some solutions -- very much a long term goal!
5. Consider adding solutions to selected problems from JR
